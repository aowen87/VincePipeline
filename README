Installation:

    Pre-reqs: Make sure that you have python 3.x installed on your machine. You should also 
              install paramiko (a python package). The auto install is set up to try and
              install paramiko for you, but this doesn't always work because of permissions. 
              If you are on Windows, make sure that you have powershell installed and are
              able to ssh into remote servers. 

    **TODO** finish auto install guide once Hiranmayi completes the GUI. 

BRAT-BW pipeline:

    Input:

        BRAT genome directory: The genome you wish to map the fastq files to. 
                               If you wish to build a genome, check the build genome
                               box and enter the name you wish to give the genome
                               directory. If you already have a genome on ACISS
                               that you'd like to use, enter the path to this 
                               directory (inclusive).

        fastq directory:       A directory containing the fastq files that you 
                               wish perform the computations on. This directory
                               should be located on ACISS. 

        results directory:     This is the directory that the results will be stored in. 
                               NOTE: you do not need to include a path when naming this 
                               directory. By default, the results directory will be created
                               in your primary pipeline directory with the given name. 

        non-BS mismatches:     The number of allowed non-bisulfite mismatches. 

        quality score:         An integer value representing the quality score. 

        build genome:          Check this box if you wish to build a genome. 

        remove extra output:   Check this box if you wish to remove extraneous output
                               that results from this section of the pipeline. By default, 
                               this box is checked. 
        
    Output: 
        
        wigFiles:
